### Traffic Violation Detection

Traffic violation detection systems are practical tools to help traffic administration monitor traffic conditions. It can detect real-time traffic violations like running red lights, speeding, and vehicle retrogress. 

The increasing number of cars in cities can cause a high traffic volume and implies that traffic violations have become more critical nowadays around the world. This causes severe destruction of property and more accidents that may endanger people's lives. Traffic violation detection systems are needed to solve the alarming problem and prevent such unfathomable consequences. The system enforces proper traffic regulations and apprehends those who do not comply. Furthermore, a traffic violation detection system must be realized in real-time as the authorities always track the roads. Hence, traffic enforcers will be at ease in implementing safe streets accurately but also efficiently, as the traffic detection system detects violations faster than humans. 

### Implement

* Implement a AI Model to Detect Traffic Violation in Python.
* Implementation should be able to infer Image and Video from different sources.
* Implementated Model should be easy to integrate with restful API frameworks.
