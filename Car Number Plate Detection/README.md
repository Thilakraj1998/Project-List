### Car Number Plate Detection and OCR
The massive integration of information technologies, under different aspects of the modern world, has led to the treatment of vehicles as conceptual resources in information systems. Since an autonomous information system has no meaning without any data, there is a need to reform vehicle information between reality and the information system. This can be achieved by human agents or by special intelligent equipment that will allow the identification of vehicles by their registration plates in real environments. Among intelligent equipment, mention is made of the system of detection and recognition of the number plates of vehicles. The system of vehicle number plate detection and recognition is used to detect the plates and then make the recognition of the plate that is to extract the text from an image and all that thanks to the calculation modules that use location algorithms, segmentation plate and character recognition. The detection and reading of license plates is a kind of intelligent system and it is considered because of the potential applications in several sectors which are quoted:

- Command force: This system is used for the detection of stolen and searched vehicles. The detected plates are compared to those of the reported vehicles.

- Parking management: The management of car entrances and exits.

- Road safety: This system is used to detect license plates exceeding a certain speed, coupling the plate reading system with road radar, crossing wildfires
