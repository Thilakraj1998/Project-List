### Celebrity Recognition



To make it easy for customers to automatically recognize tens of thousands of well-known personalities in images and videos using machine learning. For example, in social media or news and entertainment industries where information gathering can be time critical, you can use this operation to identify celebrities in an image, and return links to celebrity webpages/Social Media Accounts, if they're available.


### Implement

Since Face Detection Problem has a wide variety of applicable Application in different domain and industries

* Develop Python Implementation of Celebrity Recognition
* Implementation should have the ability to infer Image files, video files, and video streams(webcams).
* Implementation should be easy to integrate with restful API frameworks.
* Output of elebrity Recognition module should be saved in respective formats.

### Usage

* Create a separate ipynb file required for model prediction/usage of model if utilizing custom trained model.
* Create a function which will handle all the data preprocessing and engineering which is required to make prediction.

### Submission

* Training Code file(.ipynb)
* Usage Code file(.ipynb)
* Saved Model file(.h5/.pickle)
