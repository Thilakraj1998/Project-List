### Video Moderation 

The daily volume of User Generated Content (UGC) and third-party content has been increasing substantially in industries like social media, e-commerce, online advertising, and photo sharing. Customers often want to review this content to ensure that their end-users are not exposed to potentially inappropriate or offensive material, such as nudity, violence, drug use, adult products, or disturbing images. In addition, broadcast and Video-On-Demand (VOD) media companies may be required to ensure that the content they create or license carries appropriate ratings as per compliance guidelines for various geographies or target audiences. Today, many companies employ teams of human moderators to review content, while others simply react to user complaints to take down offensive images, ads, or videos. However, human moderators alone cannot scale to meet these needs at sufficient quality or speed, leading to a poor user experience, high costs to achieve scale, or even a loss of brand reputation.


The system should be able to classification Video content impacts/type,

* Develop Python Implementation of Video Moderation using AI/ML technique
* Implementation should have the ability to infer video files, and video streams(webcams).
* Implementation should be easy to integrate with restful API frameworks.

### Usage

* Create a separate ipynb file required for model prediction/usage of module.
* Create a function which handle all the data preprocessing and engineering which is required to make prediction.

### Submission

* Training Code file(.ipynb)
* Usage Code file(.ipynb)
* Saved Model file(.h5/.pickle)
