### Spam Moderation

Spam moderation is a program used to detect unsolicited, unwanted, and virus-infected emails and prevent those messages from getting into a user's inbox. Like other types of filtering programs, a spam filter looks for specific criteria on which to base its judgments.

Internet service providers, free online email services, and businesses use email filtering tools to reduce the spam distribution risk. For example, one of the simplest and earliest versions of spam filtering, like the one that Microsoft's Hotmail used, was set to watch out for particular words in the subject lines of messages. An email was excluded from the user's inbox whenever the filter recognized one of the specified words.

This method is not especially effective and often omits legitimate messages, called "false positives," while letting actual spam messages through.



### Implement
