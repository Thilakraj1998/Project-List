### Text To Image Generator

Text-to-image synthesis aims to generate a photo-realistic image from a given natural language description.
Synthesizing high-quality images from text descriptions is a challenging problem in computer vision and has many practical applications. Samples generated by existing text-to-image approaches can roughly reflect the meaning of the given descriptions, but they fail to contain necessary details and vivid object parts.


### Implement

The system should perform Text Moderation,

* Develop Python Implementation of text to Image Translation 
* Implementation should be easy to integrate with restful API frameworks.

### Usage

* Create a separate ipynb file required for model prediction and usage of the model if you are utilising the custom-trained model. If the implementation doesn't require any AI or ML model training or uses a specialised library, avoid creating a separate training ipynb file.
* Create a function which will handle all the data preprocessing and engineering which is required to make prediction.

### Submission

To make a successful submission to the project repository, the following files have to be submitted:

* Training Code file(.ipynb):- AI/ML model training file for reproducibility of the results.
* Usage Code file(.ipynb):- A usage file to utilize the model for prediction/Recognition.
* Saved Model file(.h5/.pickle):- Saved Trained Model in appropriate/accepted format


### Note

In Usage, file creates a function main() accepting  input text. Through this function, other required functions to make detection/prediction should be called and return output in the appropriate format.

Input must be simple description of the image to generate
```
def main(input):  
    """
      param1: String : text description for the image generator
      return: JSON : output of the model prediction

    """
    #perform following tasks:
    #1. checks if the string is validate URL and download file into the working directory,uses the downloaded file path else use the simple string text for futher task
    #2. perform preprocessing on the data.
    #3. perform prediction on the given data and produce respective output
    #4. return output :output must be a json, which included output prediction. for example {"prediction":"PATH OF THE SAVED RESULTING IMAGE"}
    
```
### YAML Configuration:

Along with the above mentioned requirements and changes, include a YAML file which contains instruction for the execution of Usage file.

YAML file contain details regarding input format,output format, usage file name which included above mentioned main function.

**example :**

```
version: 1
input:
  type: text
output:
  type: Image
requirement: requirement.txt
main: main.ipynb
```

Also include requirement.txt file in the submission with required version of the library mentioned in it.
