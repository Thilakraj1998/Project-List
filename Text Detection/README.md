### Text Detection

Text detection is the technique of detecting text in a picture and then enclosing it with a rectangular bounding box. Text can be detected using image-based or frequency-based algorithms.


The system should detect Text,

* Develop Python Implementation of Text Detection
* Implementation should have the ability to infer Image files, video files, and video streams(webcams).
* Implementation should be easy to integrate with restful API frameworks.
* Output of detection module should be saved in respective formats(has per input format).

### Usage

* Create a separate ipynb file required for model prediction and usage of the model if you are utilising the custom-trained model. If the implementation doesn't require any AI or ML model training or uses a specialised library, avoid creating a separate training ipynb file.
* Create a function which will handle all the data preprocessing and engineering which is required to make prediction.

### Submission

To make a successful submission to the project repository, the following files have to be submitted:

* Training Code file(.ipynb):- AI/ML model training file for reproducibility of the results.
* Usage Code file(.ipynb):- A usage file to utilize the model for prediction/Recognition.
* Saved Model file(.h5/.pickle):- Saved Trained Model in appropriate/accepted format
