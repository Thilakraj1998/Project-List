Text detection is the technique of detecting text in a picture and then enclosing it with a rectangular bounding box. Text can be detected using image-based or frequency-based algorithms.


The system should detect Text,

* Develop Python Implementation of Text Detection
* Implementation should have the ability to infer Image files, video files, and video streams(webcams).
* Implementation should be easy to integrate with restful API frameworks.
* Output of detection module should be saved in respective formats(has per input format).
