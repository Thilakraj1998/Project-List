### Helmet Detection

The primary safety equipment of motorcyclists is the helmet. The helmet protects the motorcyclist against accidents. Although helmet use is mandatory in many countries, some motorcyclists do not use or misuse them. Over the past years, many works have been carried out in traffic analysis, including vehicle detection, classification, and helmet detection. Intelligent traffic systems were implemented using computer vision algorithms, such as background and foreground image detection to segment the moving objects in the scene and image descriptors to extract features. Computational intelligence algorithms are used, too, like machine learning algorithms, to classify the objects. 


So, it is necessary to develop a system for automatically detecting helmet wearing for road safety using AI technique. Thus, a custom object detection model is created using a Machine learning-based algorithm that can detect Motorcycle riders.

### Implement

* Develop Python Implementation of Helmet Detection
* Implementation should have the ability to infer Image files, video files, and video streams(webcams).
* Implementation should be easy to integrate with restful API frameworks.


### Usage

* Create a separate ipynb file required for model prediction/usage of module.
* Create a function which handle all the data preprocessing and engineering which is required to make prediction.

### Submission

* Training Code file(.ipynb)
* Usage Code file(.ipynb)
* Saved Model file(.h5/.pickle)
