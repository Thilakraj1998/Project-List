### Brand Detection

Brand detection is a specialized mode of object detection that uses a database of thousands of global logos to identify commercial brands in images or videos. You can use this feature, for example, to discover which brands are most popular on social media or most prevalent in media product placement.


### Implement

* Implement a Computer Vision python model to detect and create Bounding box around a detected brand model.
* The implementation should be able to infer images and video streams from various sources and types.
* Implementated Model should be easy to integrate with restful API frameworks.


### Usage

* Create a separate ipynb file required for model prediction/usage of model if utilizing custom trained model.
* Create a function which will handle all the data preprocessing and engineering which is required to make prediction.

### Submission

* Training Code file(.ipynb)
* Usage Code file(.ipynb)
* Saved Model file(.h5/.pickle)
