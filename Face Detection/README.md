## Face Detection

* Face detection also called facial detection is an artificial intelligence (AI) based computer technology used to find and identify human faces in digital images. 
* Face detection technology can be applied to various fields including security, biometrics, law enforcement, entertainment and personal safety to provide surveillance and tracking of people in real-time.
* Face detection has progressed from rudimentary computer vision techniques to advances in machine learning (ML) to increasingly sophisticated artificial neural networks (ANN) and related technologies; the result has been continuous performance improvements. 
* It now plays an important role as the first step in many key applications -- including face tracking, face analysis and facial recognition. Face detection has a significant effect on how sequential operations will perform in the application.

### Implement

Since Face Detection Problem has a wide variety of applicable Application in different domain and industries

* Develop Python Implementation of Face Detection
* Implementation should have the ability to infer Image files, video files, and video streams(webcams).
* Implementation should be easy to integrate with restful API frameworks.
* Output of face detection module should be saved in respective formats.

### Usage

* Create a separate ipynb file required for model prediction/usage of module.
* Create a function which handle all the data preprocessing and engineering which is required to make prediction.

### Submission

* Training Code file(.ipynb)
* Usage Code file(.ipynb)
* Saved Model file(.h5/.pickle)
